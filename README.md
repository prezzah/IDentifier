# IDentifier
CLI Steam AppID Scraper - precursor to a current project

## Find Steam AppID(s) easily
IDentifier allows users to easily search for and copy the AppID of any steam title(s) directly to the clipboard through a simple Python command-line interface.
This was a small project that I worked on to not have to go to SteamDB or scrub through a URL link whenever I wanted to get a Steam game's AppID, hope it serves you well!
